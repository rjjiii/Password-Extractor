Transfer passwords between browsers. Export your passwords to XML or CSV files to transfer them between browsers. This extension for K-Meleon can also be installed on other browsers that use XUL including SeaMonkey, Pale Moon, Mypal, and Waterfox Classic. Its XML export/import format is also used by Password Exporter (for Firefox and SeaMonkey) and Password Backup Tool (for Pale Moon and Basilisk). Its CSV export format is compatible with popular browsers and password managers including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, KeePass, and KeePassXC. To import passwords from another browser's CSV password export use the [appropriate conversion tool](https://rjjiii.github.io/Password-Extractor/CSVtoXML.html).
